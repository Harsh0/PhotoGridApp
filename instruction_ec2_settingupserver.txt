1. open port 80 in inbound rule for http incoming traffic
2. if using socket(emit from client), open all port of tcp
3. if server is running on diffrent port then we need to do port forwarding to run that server on port 80
-for port forwarding, first we need to do ip forwarding
-for ip forwarding, process are following:-
## first open etc/sysctl.conf in vim editor using admin privilidge using command "sudo vim etc/sysctl.conf" and press ENTER
## Uncomment the line "net.ipv4.ip_forward=1" by pressing INSERT key and edit and press ESC, which will allow the functionality of ip forwarding
## save the file by typing ":wq" and press ENTER
## now to activate the changes we need to type "sudo sysctl -p /etc/sysctl.conf" and press ENTER, which will output net.ipv4.ipo_forward =1(this sets up the ip forwarding)
-now ip forwarding is done, for port forwarding, as our server is running at port 3000, process are following:-
## type "sudo iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 3000" and press ENTER
## now port forwarding is active, now we will configure the linux firewall to allow port 80 by typing "sudo  iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --sport 80 -j ACCEPT" and press ENTER
## now we have to do same thing for the output as well by typing  "sudo  iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp -m tcp --sport 80 -j ACCEPT" and press ENTER
-now if we restart the server, this setting will not persist , to make it persist, process are follow:-
## first we will install the package called iptables-persistent by typing "sudo apt-get install iptables-persistent"
## once this is done type 'sudo bash -c "iptables-save > /etc/iptables.rules.v4"' and press ENTER, this ensure after restart of server linux firewall still forward port
4. Now there is only one issue will remain which is that you have to start server again after restarting the server, to fix this process are follow
-first we will install the package called upstart
## to do this type "sudo apt-get install upstart" and press ENTER
-now we need to write
## once this is install  go into /etc/init folder by typing "cd /etc/init" and press ENTER
## create file inside folder by typing "sudo vim photogrid.conf" (here my project is photogrid so i named it like that)
## edit the file by typing text written in next few lines between multihypen lines, ensure change text accordingly
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
description "Photogrid"

start on started mountall
stop on shutdown

respawn
respawn limit 99 5

env NODE_ENV=production

exec node /home/ubuntu/photogrid/app.js >> /var/log/photogrid.log 2>&1
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$$ here respawn limit 99 5 means upstart should try and restart the app for maximum of 99 times with a gap of 5 second between the restart
## save the file by typing INSERT key and ESC key and type ":wq" and presss ENTER
5. now for starting the app type "sudo start photogrid" and press ENTER (name the same as conf file), it will output photogrid start/running, process 1322
-now reboot the server and check, all is running fine
